===

A light QML only and online only TT-RSS (tt-rss.org) client for SailfishOS.
Uses JSON API to fetch the data from your own server - which you need to have if you're going to use the client.

Features
==
- Adjustable font size so that you can choose between seeing more or seeing better
- Automatic and lockable screen orientation
- Incremental loading while scrolling the list of headlines
- Unread headlines are listed oldest to newest, read in reverse order
- Reversable order (unread newest to oldest, read oldest to newest)

TODO
==
- Labels are not implemented yet
- Image pre-loading is not implemented, although images could be preloaded on the server and hence pre-fetched
- Server/profile is not implemented
